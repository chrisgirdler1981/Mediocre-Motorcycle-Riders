# Website for Mediocre Motorcycle Riders

This is a simple 4-page website created using HTML, CSS and javascript for a Young Motorcycling Community who are without any kind of website other than the Facebook group they grew on.

[Here is the link to the site](https://chrisgirdler1981.github.io/Mediocre-Motorcycle-riders/index.html)

## Description

this website was to be designed in a way that has a simple layout, as it is informative and directional towards the facebook entity. I wanted to include some interactivity with Javascript, such as the adaptive Nav and the interactive gallery. 

## Pages

1. **Home:** This page serves as the landing page for the website.
2. **About:** Provides information about the club 
3. **Gallery:** a gallery of images from the groups activities
4. **Contact:** Provides a link to the clubs Facebook group.

## Objectives

1. To build a basic website for the group, to be informative and directional.
2. A familiar design and feel on each page for a positive user experience.
3. Adaptive Nav on each page
4. Gallery to be interactive
5. to link Social media community to users. 

## Wireframes

The following wireframes give an idea of the overall look per page.

I wanted the responsiveness to be of a similar layout wherever possible on a smaller device, just relative. I deployed bootstrap to help with this, I also liked the standard font which would work well with what I wanted to achieve. I also used media queries. 

## Building

**Methods**

I used the same approach as previous, with Replit to write alot of the code, I would effectively write the code and constantly test per page to get where I wanted to, then move the code piece by piece once tested and proven working over to Gitpod and version control/commits. This method worked really well for me as I had a playground, sandbox and safety net which is a similar concept to the LMS. 

**The Home page**
The home page was to be a simple landing page, I used the same boilerplate and Javascript for the reactive NAV throughout the other pages. I had decided to use similar colours to Facebook as thats where the community resides.

**The About Page**
I created an interactive toggle for the “founders” picture using javascript. This can be toggled on or off.

**The Gallery**

I wanted this gallery to be the best part of the site, with javascript for interactivity and a modal it did exactly what I wanted.

**Contact page**
I wanted the contact for to have an interactive link to the facebook group, so I used a picture to use as my button and some javascript to make the button interactive. 
The emphasis is on the facebook group as that’s where the community resides. I also used a traditional button with interactivity for email contact.

## Debugging

I had some minor errors to resolve in the code, some HTML and some CSS not things that affected the end site but did need remedial. quickly resolved
I believe the methods i use with replit as a playground and building area help me refine alot before it is moved over to gitpod. this would reduce some of these issues.


## Resources

**Below are resources I have used to build the site, alot has been done with the use of cheatsheets.**

*Bootstrap for responsiveness.

*Google Photo's for hosting.

*FontAwesome for all fonts used.

*W3Schools for javascript concepts

*CSS-tricks for Javascript ideas

*Mediocre motorcycle club for media content.

*Git for version control.

*Replit for use as a sandbox.

## Version-control

I used version control, also building the code on Replit and only moving it over to gitpod once working.
I find this belt and braces approach has served me well previously as it gives me a playground as I am working but I can revert back to previous versions easily. 

## Deployment

I used GitHub pages to deploy my site. This required me to go to my project repository and then:

1. Click on the 'Settings' tab.
2. Select 'Pages' from the menu that appears on the left.
3. Select 'Deploy from a branch'.
4. Select 'Main' in the drop-down menu called 'Select Branch'.
5. Then alongside 'Main', there is a folder dropdown where you select '/Root'.
6. Click 'Save' button.
7. Refresh the page and a link to the live project will appear at the top of the page.
